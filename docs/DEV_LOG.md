## Version: V7.18.2 (HUD Redesign & Visual Optimization)
**Date:** 2024-06-06
**Branch:** `main`
**Status:** ✅ CURRENT

### Features & Fixes
- **HUD Redesign**: Completely refactored the Top-Left Distance display in `PlayRound`.
  - **Vertical Stack**: Layout changed to logical depth order (Back -> Pin -> Front).
  - **Minimalist UI**: Removed redundant text labels ("Front", "Back", "To Pin") to reduce clutter.
  - **Typography**: Significantly increased font sizes. Pin distance is now ultra-prominent (5XL), with legibly large edge distances (LG).
- **Visual Balance**: Adjusted the transparency and compact nature of the HUD card to balance against the right-side tool menu.

## Version: V7.18.1 (UI Polish)
**Date:** 2024-06-06
**Branch:** `main`
**Status:** ✅ ARCHIVED

### Features & Fixes
- **UI Refinement**: Replaced "Tee Off" emojis (🚀/🛰️) with professional Lucide icons (`Rocket`/`Satellite`) to maintain visual consistency with the app's dark/professional theme.
- **Style Unification**: Updated the Tee Off button gradient to match the standard blue action buttons (`from-blue-600 to-blue-700`), removing conflicting colors.
- **Interaction Feedback**: Polished the long-press progress bar animation for the "From GPS" action.

## Version: V7.18.0 (Advanced Stats & GPS Tee)
**Date:** 2024-06-06
**Branch:** `main`
**Status:** ✅ ARCHIVED

### Features & Fixes
- **GPS Tee-Off**: Added long-press (3s) functionality to the "TEE OFF" button. Users can now reset the hole starting point to their current GPS location (e.g., if playing from a different tee box or a specific practice spot).
- **Advanced Analytics**: Completely overhauled the `RoundSummary` page.
  - Added Front 9 / Back 9 / Total split analysis table.
  - Added a traditional horizontal Scorecard Grid view for detailed hole-by-hole review.
  - Added detailed stats including "Average Putts" and "GIR %".
- **Smart Course Data**: Implemented a fallback algorithm for Green Front/Back coordinates. If a course lacks specific edge data, the app now automatically calculates virtual Front/Back points based on the hole orientation and a standard 15-yard radius.

## Version: V7.17.1 (Annotation Tools Repair)
**Date:** 2024-06-06
**Branch:** `main`
**Status:** ✅ ARCHIVED

### Features & Fixes
- **Annotation Mode Fixed**: Restored the missing toolbar for Text, Pin, Drawing, and Eraser tools in `PlayRound`.
- **Map Interaction**: Fixed conflicts where dragging map markers or interacting with UI would accidentally pan the map (updated `RotatedMapHandler`).
- **Drawing Tools**: Added specific "Save" and "Clear" actions for the pen tool to ensure lines are committed correctly.
- **Text Input**: Implemented a modal for entering text notes on the map to prevent layout shifts.
